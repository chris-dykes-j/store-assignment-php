# Storefront Assignment

This assignment was worked on piece by piece for the entire semester. The goal was to create a store front that provided a service, with the LAMP stack, and to demonstrate understanding of how to use JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

The final project was somewhat rushed but was good enough for the assignment's requirements; I would like to eventually improve the website search function by implementing AJAX, and redesigning some of the visuals.
