# Storefront Assignment

This assignment was a hot mess; website was worked on piece by piece for the entire semester. The idea was to create a site that provided some sort of service, but the vision of the site and what we actually had to make was hardly cohesive.

I would like to fix the website and make it look nicer; I will be implementing some AJAX for the search function, and redesigning some of the visuals... eventually.
